## 📝Important Notes

- Head over to the "releases" section to check out the latest updates.

- We usually update the hosts file to block current malicious software and ads. This is super important.

- Please avoid using this module together with the AdAway application and the systemless hosts module.

- Also, please double-check that the hosts file is up-to-date using any hosts manager or file manager. If it's not, give me a shout!
