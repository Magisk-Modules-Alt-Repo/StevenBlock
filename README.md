## Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.): Enlightening Insights

#### How does the Hosts file work and where is it on your system?

The hosts file, located in `/system/etc`, serves as a local gatekeeper, regulating access to specific websites by intercepting connection attempts and allowing you direct control over website accessibility.

#### How does it block websites and what improvements have been made?

The hosts file blocks websites by redirecting connection attempts to a null address, making the specified websites inaccessible. Recent improvements include merging multiple files into one comprehensive unit, expanding its capability to block over 100,000 to 200,000 malicious entities.

#### How can one explore the blocked domains effortlessly?

To explore blocked domains, search for "hosts manager" or "hosts editor" on Google Play or F-Droid. These tools provide user-friendly interfaces with comprehensive lists of blocked domains for easy management and customization.
