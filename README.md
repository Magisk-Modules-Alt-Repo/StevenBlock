## Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.): Enlightening Insights

**How does the hosts file functionality operate, and where can it be found within your system?**

- The `hosts` file, located in `/system/etc`, functions as a vigilant gatekeeper, regulating access to specific websites locally within the root system of your device. It intercepts connection attempts, ensuring direct control over website access.

**But how does it block websites, and what enhancements have been made?**

- The hosts file employs a simple yet effective blocking mechanism by redirecting connection attempts to a null address, rendering designated websites inaccessible. Recent enhancements involve consolidating multiple files into one comprehensive entity, expanding its capabilities to block over 100,000 - 200,000 detrimental entities.

**How can one explore the blocked domains effortlessly?**

- Exploring blocked domains is straightforward. Simply search for "hosts manager" or "hosts editor" on Google Play or F-Droid. These tools offer user-friendly interfaces, providing comprehensive lists of blocked domains for easy management and customization.

## Important Information & Latest Updates: Stay in the Loop

**A Quick Note**

- If you're using any root solution, there's no need to install your systemless hosts module separately. Please check that it works after installing the module.
  
- Also, please note that the module will not have any impact on the browser; it will block domains but will not benefit ads.

**Stay Updated**

- Our module receives regular updates, typically 1-2 times per week. Stay informed about the latest developments by starring our project on GitHub!

- You probably should see "update" in your root solution every time an update comes. This works for Magisk, but I haven't tried it for others. If it doesn't work, occasionally check the GitHub repository or star the repo to stay informed about updates!
