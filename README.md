## Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.)

**How does the functionality of the hosts file operate, and where can you locate it within your system?**

- The ``hosts`` file, residing in ``/system/etc``, functions akin to a vigilant gatekeeper, meticulously regulating access to specific websites. Rather than employing a distant server, it operates locally within the root system of your phone, ensuring direct control over website access.

**But how does this file enact its web-blocking prowess, and what enhancements have been made?**

- The hosts file employs a straightforward yet effective blocking mechanism, thwarting access to designated websites and potential threats by intercepting connection attempts and redirecting them to a null address. For instance, a blocked website like www.the-website-that-is-blocked.com would be rendered inaccessible through an entry like 0.0.0.0 in the hosts file.

- In recent modifications, the hosts file underwent significant augmentation through sourcing from Hosts file provider. This consolidation of four distinct files into one comprehensive entity has bolstered its capabilities, now boasting the capability to block over 100.000 - 200.000 detrimental entities ranging from spyware and malware to intrusive ads.

**Now, how can one effortlessly peruse these myriad blocked domains?**

- Discovering the array of blocked domains is a seamless endeavor! Simply venture to Google Play or F-Droid and initiate a search for "hosts manager" or "hosts editor." These tools furnish a user-friendly interface, swiftly furnishing you with a comprehensive list of the domains barred by your hosts file, facilitating effortless management and customization.

**Where can the source codes be found?**

- The source codes were removed from the repository as they were included in the install.zip file.
