# StevenBlock
This module enables you to block advertisements in your device's in-applications by adding a file hosted by Stevenblack to your device. This does not cover in-browser ads or YouTube advertisements; it only imposes access restrictions for specific domains.

# Note
When using with magisk or kernelsu, there is no need to install your systemless hosts module.

# Updates
The module is updated regularly 1-2 times a week.

# Releases
