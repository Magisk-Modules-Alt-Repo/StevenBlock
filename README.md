## Total Blocked Domains

(100.000 - 200.000) Malware, Ads, Spyware

## How does it work?

**The file's location?**

- Your ``hosts`` file can be found in ``/system/etc``. It functions similarly to a school blocking service, preventing access to certain websites. However, this file operates locally within your phone's root system.

**How does the hosts file block websites, and what changes were implemented?**

- Blocking Mechanism: The hosts file inhibits access to websites and malware by prohibiting your phone from connecting to them altogether, resulting in a blank page. Example: 0.0.0.0 www.the-website-that-is-blocked.com.

- Modifications: The hosts file was sourced from Hosts file provider. Combining four separate files into one comprehensive file, it now blocks over 180,000 harmful and bothersome websites including spyware, malware, and ads.

**How can I see these domains in an easy way?**

- Finding these domains is a breeze! Just head to Google Play or F-Droid and search for "hosts manager" or "hosts editor" to access a range of tools that will swiftly provide you with the results you seek.
