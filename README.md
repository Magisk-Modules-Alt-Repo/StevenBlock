## Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.): Enlightening Insights

**How does the Hosts file work and where is it on your system?**

- The hosts file, located in /system/etc, acts as a vigilant gatekeeper, regulating access to specific websites locally within your device's root system. It intercepts connection attempts and ensures direct control over website access.

**But how does it block websites and what improvements have been made?**

- The Hosts file uses a simple but effective blocking mechanism by redirecting connection attempts to a null address, rendering the specified websites inaccessible. Recent enhancements include the consolidation of multiple files into one comprehensive unit, extending its capabilities to block over 100,000 - 200,000 malicious entities.

**How can one explore the blocked domains effortlessly?**

- Finding blocked domains is easy. Just search for hosts manager or hosts editor on Google Play or F-Droid. These tools offer user-friendly interfaces and provide comprehensive lists of blocked domains for easy management and customisation.

## Important Information & Latest Updates: Stay in the Loop

**A Quick Note**

- If you're using any root solution, there's no need to install your systemless hosts module separately. Please check that it works after installing the module. Also, do not use this module with Adaway.
  
- Also, please note that the module will not have any impact on the browser; it will block domains but will not benefit ads.

**Stay Updated**

- Our module receives regular updates, typically 1-2 times per week. Stay informed about the latest developments by starring our project on GitHub!

- You probably should see update in your root solution every time an update comes. This works for Magisk, but I haven't tried it for others. If it doesn't work, occasionally check the GitHub repository or star the repo to stay informed about updates!
