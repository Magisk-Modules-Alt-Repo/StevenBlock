## Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.)

> [!NOTE]
> #### How does the Hosts file work and where is it on your system?
> The hosts file, located in `/system/etc`, serves as a local gatekeeper, regulating access to specific websites by intercepting connection attempts and allowing you direct control over website accessibility.

> [!NOTE]
> #### How does it block websites and what improvements have been made?
> The hosts file blocks websites by redirecting connection attempts to a null address, making the specified websites inaccessible. Recent improvements include merging multiple files into one comprehensive unit, expanding its capability to block over 100,000 to 200,000 malicious entities.

> [!NOTE]
> #### How can one explore the blocked domains effortlessly?
> To explore blocked domains, search for "hosts manager" or "hosts editor" on Google Play or F-Droid. These tools provide user-friendly interfaces with comprehensive lists of blocked domains for easy management and customization.

## Important Information & Latest Updates

> If you’re using any root solution, there's no need to install your systemless hosts module separately. After installing the module, ensure it’s working correctly. Avoid using this module with AdAway.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Note that while the module blocks domains, it will not affect browser-based ads.

> [!TIP]
> The module receives regular updates, typically 1-2 times per week. To stay informed, star our project on GitHub. Updates should appear in your root solution automatically, but if they don't, check the GitHub repository periodically to stay updated.
